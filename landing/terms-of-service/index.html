                    <p>
                        Welcome to Ephemeral! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
                        Ephemeral website and note-sharing service (the "Service"), operated by the Ephemeral team
                        ("us", "we", or "our"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with
                        any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

                    <h3 class="content-heading">1. Description of Service</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ephemeral provides a service that allows users to create notes that can be shared via unique
                        links. Users can choose options for these notes, including setting them to self-destruct after
                        one view, expire after a certain time, or remain permanent. Users can also optionally
                        password-protect notes for client-side end-to-end encryption. The core service does not require
                        user accounts or login.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="content-heading">2. Acceptable Use & User Conduct</h3>

                        content you create and share. You agree <b>not</b> to:

                        though our ability to identify violating users is limited by our no-logs and no-account
                        policies.

                    <h3 class="content-heading">3. Compliance with Laws</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all laws, rules, and
                        regulations applicable to you in your jurisdiction. Access to the Service from territories where
                        its contents are illegal is prohibited.

                    <h3 class="content-heading">4. Intellectual Property</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Service and its original content (excluding user-created note content), features, and
                        functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Ephemeral and its licensors. The
                        Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.

                    <h3 class="content-heading">5. Disclaimers</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the Service is at
                        your sole risk. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or
                        implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
                        particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ephemeral does not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available
                        at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service
                        is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet
                        your requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You acknowledge that while password-protected notes utilize strong encryption, the security of
                        unprotected notes relies on server security and they are stored as plaintext. You acknowledge
                        that "permanent" notes are stored indefinitely and choose this option at your own discretion.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="content-heading">6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                        In no event shall Ephemeral, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or
                        affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
                        including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses,
                        resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any
                        conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the
                        Service (including note content created by other users); and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or
                        alteration of your transmissions or content (including note content), whether based on warranty,
                        contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been
                        informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to
                        have failed of its essential purpose.
